Hi 👋🏼!

I'm Jess, a Content Developer at [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com/) <img height="15" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/349332/datacamp.svg">.

Since 2017, I have worked in the data & analytics space. Most of my career to date has been spent as a BI/Data Analyst but most recently I joined DataCamp to help expand their growing BI curriculum. This has enabled me to enhance my skills further whilst delivering courses to learners across the globe. 

I'm interested in all things data but have a particular interest in Visualization.
